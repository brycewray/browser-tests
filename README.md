# Browser tests

This is where I keep version-controlled tests on [various web browsers](/browsers.md), along with [the files I originally maintained before deciding this project’s output was worth VC’ing](/pre-git).

The tests are on browsers in [macOS](/macos-2023-mac-studio.md) and [Linux](/fedora-linux-2017-imac.md). All timestamps within are in U.S. Central time (CDT/CST), with dates in `yyyy-mm-dd` format.

> I have no **reliable** way to run tests in Windows. I am using Macs: an Apple Silicon model for macOS, and an Intel model for Linux. While the Apple Silicon Mac does have Parallels Desktop emulation of the ARM version of Windows 11, I’ve noticed enough oddities in running browsers on that platform that I simply don’t trust test results from Windows 11 on ARM, period, much less from **emulated** Windows 11 on ARM.
