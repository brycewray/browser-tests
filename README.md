# Browser tests

This is where I keep version-controlled tests on various web browsers, along with the files I originally maintained before deciding this project’s output was worth VC’ing.

The tests are on browsers in [macOS](https://github.com/brycewray/browser-tests/blob/main/macos-2023-mac-studio.md) and [Linux](https://github.com/brycewray/browser-tests/blob/main/fedora-linux-2017-imac.md).

> [!NOTE]
> I have no **reliable** way to run tests in Windows. I am using Macs, one for macOS and one for Linux. While one of the Macs does have Parallels Desktop emulation of the ARM version of Windows 11, I’ve noticed enough oddities in running browsers on that platform that I simply don’t trust test results from Windows 11 on ARM, period, much less from **emulated** Windows 11 on ARM.
