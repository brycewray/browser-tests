## Addendum, 2023-10-13

After seeing that Firefox isn't yet optimized for Wayland except in 
distro-specific versions, with Arch being one of the distros mentioned,
I decided to re-try some of the tests with the Arch distro of Firefox, 
as well as distro-specific versions of other browsers.


Firefox from Arch, v.118.0.2
